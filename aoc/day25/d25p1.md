# Day 25: Reactor Core Synchronization - Part 1

The final day has arrived! Deep in the elves' underground workshop, the reactor cores are ready to be activated for Christmas Eve production.

Your snowman companion leads you to the main control panel. "The reactor network needs to be initialized," explains the head engineer elf. "We need to send activation signals from the entrance to each reactor core."

## Part 1: Power-Up Sequence

The underground facility is a network of chambers connected by tunnels. Each tunnel has a certain length (in meters). To initialize the reactor network, you need to send an activation signal from the **entrance chamber** (marked "START") to every **reactor core** chamber.

The signal travels at 1 meter per second through the tunnels. Once a signal reaches a chamber, it can split and continue down multiple tunnels simultaneously.

### Input Format

```
START-A:10
START-B:15
A-C:5
B-C:8
B-D:12
C-REACTOR_1:20
D-REACTOR_2:15
D-E:10
E-REACTOR_3:25
```

Each line describes a tunnel between two chambers with its length. Reactor cores are labeled as `REACTOR_1`, `REACTOR_2`, etc.

### Example

```
START-A:10
A-REACTOR_1:5
START-B:20
B-REACTOR_1:5
```

Visualization:
```
        10         5
START -----> A -----> REACTOR_1
  |                      ^
  |20                    |5
  +-------> B -----------+
```

The signal can reach REACTOR_1 via two paths:
- START → A → REACTOR_1: 10 + 5 = **15 seconds** ✓ (fastest)
- START → B → REACTOR_1: 20 + 5 = **25 seconds**

Since the signal takes the fastest path, REACTOR_1 activates after **15 seconds**.

### Question

**What is the time (in seconds) when the LAST reactor core receives its activation signal?**

In other words, find the shortest path from START to each reactor, and report the maximum of these times.

### Your Task

Parse the tunnel network, find the shortest path from START to each REACTOR, and report the longest of these shortest paths.

---

## Hints

- This is a straightforward shortest-path problem
- Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest paths from START to all nodes
- Track which nodes are reactors and find the maximum time among them
- Expected runtime: < 1 second
